Software designed to let you play Tic Tac Toe by taking turns on a single device, created by Garret Snitchler.
This is a personal, solo project done to get my feet wet with Godot and to get something up on my non-school Github account.

This project is considered complete and will not be receiving any further updates beyond maintenance.
